## Project Overview

**MyFlashCardApp** is a native Android application built using **Kotlin** in **Android Studio**, developed as part of an assignment to test knowledge using flashcards. The app presents flashcard-style questions on the subject of history, collects responses from users, and provides a final score with feedback.

---

## Purpose of the App

The purpose of this application is to:
- Support students in self-assessment through quiz-based learning.
- Reinforce knowledge retention using flashcards.
- Provide immediate feedback and scoring based on responses.
- Demonstrate mobile development skills in Kotlin and best practices in using GitHub and GitHub Actions.

---

## Design Considerations

- **User Interface**: Clean, simple, and intuitive UI with buttons for answering questions and navigating between flashcards.
- **Question Management**: The app loops through five history-based flashcard questions, capturing user selections and tallying scores.
- **Score Feedback**: At the end of the quiz, users receive a score and appropriate feedback.
- **Responsiveness**: Designed to run smoothly on different Android screen sizes.
- **Code Comments**: Includes in-line code comments for clarity and maintainability.
- **Review Page**: Includes a page for you to review through all the questions and their answers.

---

## GitHub & GitHub Actions

- **Version Control**: The entire project is maintained using [GitHub](https://github.com/Jean-glitch22/MyFlashCardApp), with proper commit messages documenting progress.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Utilized **GitHub Actions** to:
  - Automatically check for build errors on push.
  - Ensure code integrity and workflow consistency.

## Report

The MyFlashCardApp is a native Android application made using Kotlin in Android Studio. Its main goal is to help students review and test their knowledge using flashcard-style questions. Flashcards are well-known for being a useful way to learn because they are simple and help people remember things through practice. This app focuses on history questions and shows five multiple-choice flashcards that the user can go through one by one. The app checks the user’s answers and gives a score at the end, helping users see what they got right and where they can improve.

The app is designed to be easy to use and understand. The user interface is clean and simple, so users can concentrate on the flashcard questions without distractions. Moving through the flashcards is easy, with “Next” and “Submit” buttons to guide the user. Each flashcard shows a clear question and several answer options, similar to a quiz. At the end of the quiz, users get a score summary, which helps them feel a sense of progress and encourages them to use the app again to keep learning.

From a technical point of view, the app follows good programming practices. The code is organized in a way that keeps the design and the main logic separate. This makes the app easier to understand, change, or grow in the future. The code includes comments that explain what each part does, making it helpful for other developers. The app also works well on different Android devices, with attention paid to screen size and performance.

GitHub was used during the whole development of this project. The repository (Jean-glitch22/MyFlashCardApp) has all the files, commits, and notes. This allowed for better version control and made it easy to save progress and go back to earlier versions if needed. GitHub Actions was also used to set up automatic tasks. One of these tasks was to build the app every time changes were made, which helped catch errors early. This process is part of modern development practices and improves the quality of the app.

An important part of this project was the help received from AI tools. AI, especially ChatGPT, was used to help organize the documentation, improve the app’s design, and make the code easier to read and understand. This shows how AI can be used in a helpful and responsible way to improve programming work.

Overall, the MyFlashCardApp is both a helpful learning tool and a good example of Android app development skills. It shows understanding of user-friendly design, smart coding methods, and using modern tools like GitHub Actions for automation. The app could be improved in the future by adding more features like different quiz topics, score history, or the ability to download flashcards from the internet.
