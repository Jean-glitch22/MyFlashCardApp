## 📱 Project Overview

**MyFlashCardApp** is a native Android application built using **Kotlin** in **Android Studio**, developed as part of an assignment to test knowledge using flashcards. The app presents flashcard-style questions on the subject of history, collects responses from users, and provides a final score with feedback.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the App

The purpose of this application is to:
- Support students in self-assessment through quiz-based learning.
- Reinforce knowledge retention using flashcard methodology.
- Provide immediate feedback and scoring based on responses.
- Demonstrate mobile development skills in Kotlin and best practices in using GitHub and GitHub Actions.

## 🛠️ Design Considerations

- **User Interface**: Clean, simple, and intuitive UI with buttons for answering questions and navigating between flashcards.
- **Question Management**: The app loops through five history-based flashcard questions, capturing user selections and tallying scores.
- **Score Feedback**: At the end of the quiz, users receive a score and appropriate feedback.
- **Responsiveness**: Designed to run smoothly on different Android screen sizes.
- **Code Comments**: Includes in-line code comments for clarity and maintainability.
- **Modular Codebase**: Separation of logic and UI components for scalability.

## 🧪 GitHub & GitHub Actions

- **Version Control**: The entire project is maintained using [GitHub](https://github.com/Jean-glitch22/MyFlashCardApp), with proper commit messages documenting progress.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Utilized **GitHub Actions** to:
  - Automatically check for build errors on push.
  - Ensure code integrity and workflow consistency.
- **Collaborative Features**: GitHub Issues and Pull Requests were explored for project management and future scalability.
